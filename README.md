Create a program that counts the number of vowels in a file.  

Requirements:
  
    • User must specify the name of the file (from the command line) to analyze when the program is run. If not, an error should be generated.
  
    • Use constants where appropriate.
  
    • Use I/O (stream) manipulators to format the output so that it is identical to the example below
  
    • Pass the name of the file to read in from the command line.
